What if we used the voices of well-educated formerly incarcerated individuals to drive meaningful reform? Drawing from the Convict Criminology perspective, which amplifies the voices of those who have lived experience, this talk will explore how CJS reform could be improved by incorporating their expertise.

Sometimes they fight these feelings, and sometimes they use these feelings to fight. In this important and revealing book, Gulzar R. Charania puts the experiences of women of colour at the centre of her investigation, sharing how they endure everyday racism, as well as its lasting impacts and exacting costs in their lives and educational trajectories.Fighting Feelings highlights how the elasticity of white supremacy invites people of colour to be its accomplices, how interlocking forms of oppression force racialized queer women to calibrate the risk of expressing their sexuality, and how schools and the nation inform the development of racial literacy. Charania traces the complex convergences, and inseparability, of race, class, gender, and sexuality in women’s lives, and the divergent political horizons that racism fosters.Told through a clear analytic lens, Fighting Feelings articulates racism as a structure, and explores the myriad ways it shapes the lives and political formation of women of colour. Charania’s analysis of the complexity of racism makes this book a critical and necessary contribution to our understanding of how white supremacy operates.",

Ellapen examines the visual and performance art practices of feminist, queer, femme, and gender-nonconforming Afro-Indian and South African black artists to understand the paradoxes of freedom in contemporary South Africa. Tracing the afterlife of apartheid-era racial categories and revisiting Bantu Stephen Biko’s Black Consciousness, Ellapen theorizes South African blackness through the Indian Ocean World, showing how the development of an Afro-Indian identity after generations of indentured labor and segregation troubles persistent racial hierarchies. Staging unexpected encounters between artists such as Sharlene Khan, Mohau Modisakeng, Lebohang Kganye, and Reshma Chhiba, he analyzes how their works challenge these racial categories to create new imaginaries of freedom. Situated in a context in which the authentic (hetero)normative black subject of the post-apartheid state is bracketed from other formulations of blackness, these artists’ aesthetic practices, alongside those of other artists like Ellapen himself, disrupt desires for national belonging and catalyze alternative and transgressive politics and subjects. By rethinking the relationship between blackness, Afro-Indianness, and Africanness, Ellapen highlights the role of the aesthetic in crafting a blueprint for coalitional building across difference in contemporary South Africa.About the Author:Jordache A.

Wenzel has used a diverse variety of media and material such as textiles, found items, animal bones, plants, soil and other organic material, as well as small electronics to produce urban interventions and objects of speculative fiction at the intersection of art, science and technology. Wenzel challenges the notion of the artwork as an object to be observed in a gallery or museum, and the gallery as a constrained space with relatively limited interactions. Her extensive body of work extends to building facades, billboards, entire neighborhoods and the city, translating into urban interventions to explore the collective production of culture and the creation and negotiation of public space.",

I am of Earth; my heart is on fire. My family is one of mystics, healers, poets, and explorers of the soil and the soul of life’s strength, tenderness, and fragility. I grew up with one wing in the wilderness and another in the magical realism of Indigenous dreamlands and stories. My Elders’ songs enthralled my childhood and enhanced my mythic imagination and emotional intuition. They’ve become the fertile soils and waters where the seeds of reverence, play, and wonder dig their roots. I am a Truth-bearer, trickster dreamer, and culture-shifter. As a scholar, I research Indigenous forms of contemplation and the transcendent experience embodied in prosocial behavior (reverence, ethics, compassion, and a sense of awe, love, and sacredness).‎ I call my research broader statement the “Ethics of Belonging,” encouraging awareness, intention, and relational actions toward planetary flourishing and a path of meaning and participation rooted in honoring Life. I am affiliated with the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, where I research Earth-based contemplation and collective flourishing in Indigenous traditions of the world. Alongside this, I am a senior fellow at the Othering and Belonging Institute; and for the American Academy of Religion, I co-chair the Indigenous Religious Traditions Unit and am on the steering committee of the Contemplative Studies Unit.<br><br><strong><a href=\"https://www.newcollege.utoronto.ca/flourishing-kin-lecture-with-dr-yuria-celidwen/#rsvptoday\">RSVP Today!</a></strong><br><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.875rem;padding: 0px\"><em>We would like to thank <a href=\"https://www.newcollege.utoronto.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New College Initiatives Fund</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.newcollege.utoronto.ca/programs/bpmh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buddhism, Psychology and Mental Health Program</a>, <a href=\"https://easelab.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EASELab</a>, <a href=\"https://khyentsefoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Khyentse Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.trinity.utoronto.ca/sustainability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trinity College’s Integrated Sustainability Initiative</a>, <a href=\"https://www.environment.utoronto.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the School of the Environment</a>, and <a href=\"https://buddhiststudies.utoronto.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Robert H.N.

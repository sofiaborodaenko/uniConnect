We will also award the Morley Gunderson Prize which honours current students or alumni who combine outstanding personal achievement with significant service to the Centre. This is a free event and all are welcome. This event is sold out for in-person. You may attend virtually via livestream. Time is our scarcest resource. Compared to income, the amount of time at our disposal has grown much less rapidly over the last century. That’s true in rich countries, like Canada and the U.S., but is increasingly also true in less developed countries. For the average working adult, work time constitutes barely 20 percent of the typical week. It is only the second most common activity, being far behind sleep time, but slightly ahead of TV-watching; and yet, economists and others analyze work time much more thoroughly than the more important non-work time. This lecture discusses both work and non-work, concentrating particularly on differences in how time is spent across such characteristics as gender, age, immigrant status, and income, and on how it is used differently across counties. Dr. Daniel Hamermesh focuses on how the shortage of time affects behavior, and how these effects differ across these same demographic and economic characteristics. He asks the question: What would we do with the extra time if we suddenly got more time each day, week, or year? The answer is surprising and fairly distressing, but his talk culminates with a discussion of policies that might make the increasing scarcity of time less burdensome.",

        "desc": "Today, the legacy of classical film theory – with its insistence on medium specificity and concern with the formal properties of film– is often framed as essentialist, ahistorical, and no longer applicable to our present media practices. As recent media-theoretical debates challenge the very association of media with the material basis of artistic or communication devices, several scholars have shifted their focus to the categories of formats and platforms, while others proposed to new conceptual formations such as elemental media, operational media, and environmental media. This lecture seeks to complicate such views regarding the distinction between the classical and current theoretical debates by drawing attention to more dynamic and historically-contingent aspects in classical film theory’s conceptions of media. Specifically, my focus is on the writings of Rudolf Arnheim, perhaps the film theorist most identified with a rigid formalist view of medium specificity. Yet, as this lecture details, Arnheim’s conception of the film medium was far more complex than merely considering it as the material support of moving images. His thoughts on media across the eight decades of his extraordinary long career prompt us to adopt a distinct understanding of medium, while also revealing that the notions of platforms and formats already introduced themselves as vital critical categories in the context of the transformation of cinema during the twentieth century.

Fed up with the gaping inequity between the value of women’s labour and women’s wages, female employees, wives and mothers just stopped—stopped working, cooking, cleaning and looking after their children—together on that fall morning. The country came to an abrupt standstill, but a revolution had begun. Fascinating archives and inspiring animation accompany new interviews with the women and activists who were there that day. Nearly 50 years later, director Pamela Hogan and producer Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir reconstruct the dramatic 12 hours that reimagined what was possible for women in Iceland—and, in fact, the world. Relive the moment—or cheer along for the first time—as these gender-equity sheroes share what it was like to throw one of the most effective and dramatic protest wrenches into the patriarchal machine.",

Racialized women and girls often feel racial injustice before they have the words to name it. Sometimes they fight these feelings, and sometimes they use these feelings to fight. In this important and revealing book, Gulzar R. Charania puts the experiences of women of colour at the centre of her investigation, sharing how they endure everyday racism, as well as its lasting impacts and exacting costs in their lives and educational trajectories. Fighting Feelings highlights how the elasticity of white supremacy invites people of colour to be its accomplices, how interlocking forms of oppression force racialized queer women to calibrate the risk of expressing their sexuality, and how schools and the nation inform the development of racial literacy. Charania traces the complex convergences, and inseparability, of race, class, gender, and sexuality in women’s lives, and the divergent political horizons that racism fosters. Told through a clear analytic lens, Fighting Feelings articulates racism as a structure, and explores the myriad ways it shapes the lives and political formation of women of colour. Charania’s analysis of the complexity of racism makes this book a critical and necessary contribution to our understanding of how white supremacy operates.",

Wenzel has used a diverse variety of media and material such as textiles, found items, animal bones, plants, soil and other organic material, as well as small electronics to produce urban interventions and objects of speculative fiction at the intersection of art, science and technology. Wenzel challenges the notion of the artwork as an object to be observed in a gallery or museum, and the gallery as a constrained space with relatively limited interactions. Her extensive body of work extends to building facades, billboards, entire neighborhoods and the city, translating into urban interventions to explore the collective production of culture and the creation and negotiation of public space.",

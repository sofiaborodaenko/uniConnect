Dr. Yuria Celidwen will share insights from her recent book Flourishing Kin: Indigenous Wisdom for Collective Well-Being, bridging Indigenous ontologies and methodologies, academic research, and poetic expression to cultivate sustainable collective flourishing through Indigenous contemplative spiritualities and sciences. Celidwen defines relationality and flourishing as a spiritual-aesthetic arrest only possible in community through cultivating relationships toward all kin, from human to more-than-human, and the living Earth.

I am of Earth; my heart is on fire. My family is one of mystics, healers, poets, and explorers of the soil and the soul of life\u2019s strength, tenderness, and fragility. I grew up with one wing in the wilderness and another in the magical realism of Indigenous dreamlands and stories. My Elders\u2019 songs enthralled my childhood and enhanced my mythic imagination and emotional intuition. They\u2019ve become the fertile soils and waters where the seeds of reverence, play, and wonder dig their roots. I am a Truth-bearer, trickster dreamer, and culture-shifter. As a scholar, I research Indigenous forms of contemplation and the transcendent experience embodied in prosocial behavior (reverence, ethics, compassion, and a sense of awe, love, and sacredness).\u200e I call my research broader statement the \u201cEthics of Belonging,\u201d encouraging awareness, intention, and relational actions toward planetary flourishing and a path of meaning and participation rooted in honoring Life. I am affiliated with the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, where I research Earth-based contemplation and collective flourishing in Indigenous traditions of the world. Alongside this, I am a senior fellow at the Othering and Belonging Institute; and for the American Academy of Religion, I co-chair the Indigenous Religious Traditions Unit and am on the steering committee of the Contemplative Studies Unit.RSVP Today!We would like to thank New College Initiatives Fund, the Buddhism, Psychology and Mental Health Program, EASELab, the Khyentse Foundation, Trinity College\u2019s Integrated Sustainability Initiative, the School of the Environment, and the Robert H.N.

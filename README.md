# uniConnect: A Centralized Hub for College Events at UofT
## A Centralized Hub for College Events at UofT

UniConnect was created to solve a common but overlooked issue at the University of Toronto: the fragmentation of college event information. With events scattered across various posters, Instagram pages, and internal mailing lists, many students are unaware of whatâ€™s happening outside their college, even though many of these events are open to everyone. 
So Dawson Li, Yi-ting Chang, Japleen Kaur and I built a unified web platform that scrapes event data from six major UofT colleges, organizes the information using an optimized tree structure, and allows users to filter, sort, and explore events dynamically through a modern Flask-based interface. The platform also includes a recommendation system that tailors results based on user preferences such as college, faculty, and event type.
